\maketitle

This project aims to synthesize a new image of Attica ca. 1971 
(contemporary to the riots) to better understand a contemporary (ca. 2025) 
political climate surrounding mass incarceration. I plan to do this 
by analysing and deconstructing contemporaneous music, essays, and letters 
primarily written by Attica inmates. Because of this, my sources seem to 
be broadly non-musical: essays, articles, letters, poems, and very few 
scores or recordings. I believe by breaking down these creative works 
to their fundamental atoms/grains, we can synthesize a better, inmate-voiced 
image of Attica by connecting themes between these works.
